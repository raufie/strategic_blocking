## Installation

Just get the exe from the dist folder, or from the release option.
Make sure to create a shortcut in windows for the executable. If you use commmand prompt make sure to use it where you intend to save config file (that is if you choose to add it to path, just go for a simpler double click )

Run as an administrator (you'll probably get a warning for icon, which I didn't include anyway)

#### So why this?

## Timer app on windows sucks...

They added a timer features on alarm and clocks, but I couldn't customize it.. You can't set your own times.. it's static.
I've been using alarms this whole time and I write the time I focus on a task in my diary, then I take that data and put it in my excel sheets (ðŸ’€ yeah.. yikes)

I hope it helps someone ðŸ’¯ thnx for reading
